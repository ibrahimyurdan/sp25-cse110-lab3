## Modifications Made to Pass Validation

To pass CSS validation, the following changes were made to the original CSS:

1. Replaced `color-mix(in srgb, white 90%, var(--primary-color) 10%)` with a custom CSS variable `--primary-color-light` defined in the `:root` selector.

2. Replaced the `@nest` rule with traditional CSS selectors.

These newer CSS features are valid and widely supported in modern browsers, but they are not yet recognized by the W3C validator since they are relatively recent additions to the CSS specification.
